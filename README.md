### Folders and what's inside
(1) folders with "Qx.x": original raw files with local environment directly uploaded from my computer, might not work on other machines

(2) folders with "Questionx.x": the files to run. Need to run the commands below in order for them to work.

### IDE and packages
(1) VSCode

(2) before running anything in folders containing the word "Question", go to VSCode terminal, run the following:
  
  (i) npm i -D webpack webpack-cli
  
  (ii) npm init (for this one, press enter for all fields if you just need the default values)
  
(3) to run, just fo to index.html, and click "go live"
